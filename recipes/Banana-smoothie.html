    <h2>A delicious banana smoothie</h2>
    <p>This banana smoothie recipe is a great way to start your day. It is full of nutrients your body loves like
        vitamin K and fiber. It is also very customizable so you can make it to your preference. My favorite add ons are
        peanut butter for additional protein and chocolate for some added flavor. This recipe makes one smoothie,
        however it can easily be doubled if needed. It is also vegan so it is a great recipe for all your dietary
        preferences.
